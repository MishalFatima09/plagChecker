# PlagChecker 🔍

**PlagChecker** is a simple plagiarism detection tool written in C++. It analyzes the similarity between two or more text/code files using string matching techniques. Built as an academic project, it helps understand how comparison algorithms can be used to detect overlapping content, even with minor changes.

## ✨ Features

- Compares multiple text or code files
- Calculates similarity percentage between documents
- Detects exact matches, partial matches, and minor edits
- Command-line interface

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- C++
- File I/O (`ifstream`, `getline`)
- String manipulation
- STL (`vector`, `map`, `string`)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MishalFatima09/plagChecker.git
   cd plagChecker
